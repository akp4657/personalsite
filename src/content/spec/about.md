# About
Hey everyone!

As a mid-level JavaScript developer, I've had the opportunity to work with early to midstage startups throughout my career. This has given me the advantage
of being adaptable, curious, and ready to wear as many hats as possible. Through these experiences, I've been able to retain my thirst for knowledge in the
tech industry.

I have worked on projects for clients in industries ranging from healthcare to legal, and through these projects I've been able to better understand the different
needs different industries need. As well, I've been able to directly communicate with clients and effectively translate the product between development teams and stakeholders.
Through strong leadership and communication skills, I've grown to become an Engineering Manager at SandBox Union early in my career

Outside of the office, I enjoy competitive fighting games, baseball, some coding challenges, and professional wrestling. Actually, I'm a professional wrestler myself. You can find me in the ring most weekends
throughout the year!
